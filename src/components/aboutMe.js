                <div> After two years of intense study in preparatory classes (CPGE),
                    I chose to pursue a Software Engineering degree in National School of Computer Science and Systems Analysis (ENSIAS) in Rabat, Morocco,
as a child, I have always been interested with computers and IT.
I regularly learn new things in tech, as I made it a habit to work everyday to sharpen my skills.
I am fluent in classics like <i className="bb">C/C++</i>, <i className="bb">Javascript</i> and <i className="bb">Python</i>.
I look forward to get my degree in 2024.
